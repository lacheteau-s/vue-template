# vue-template
A boilerplate for [Vue] projects using Vue 3 with [TypeScript], [Single-File Components], and [Composition API].

This template is built on top of the code generated by [vuejs/create-vue] (the official Vue project scaffolding tool) with the following configuration:

```
✔️ TypeScript
❌ JSX Support
❌ Vue Router
❌ Pinia
❌ Vitest
❌ End-to-End Testing Solution
❌ ESLint
```

With the exception of TypeScript, any other [feature] implemented in this template was added and configured manually for my own personal educational [purpose].

While `vuejs/create-vue` creates a generic template with a bunch of features pre-configured to fit most use cases, this template is an opinionated, stripped-down version.

As such, it is **NOT** meant as an alternative to `vuejs/create-vue`.
For all intents and purposes, I do recommend that you use `vuejs/create-vue` to initialize your Vue projects.

## Features

**Current [template version]:** `template/base`

In addition to TypeScript and Vue, this template contains the following features:

| Feature | Libraries |
|---------|------------|
| Code formatting | [prettier] |
| Linting | [eslint], [typescript-eslint], [eslint-plugin-vue], [eslint-plugin-prettier], [eslint-config-prettier] |

### Template version

This repository offers various template versions, each with a different set of extra features, as listed above.

Each version lives on a dedicated branch derived from the base version (`template/base`) and named in such a way as to reflect the feature(s) it includes (`template/[feature(s)]`). For instance, `template/pinia` adds support for [state management] with [Pinia].

You may find more details about a specific template and its features in this README on the branch in question.

For a complete list of available templates, refer to the [releases].

### Why not implement an [npm initializer]?

After a brief consideration, I determined that it wouldn't be worth the effort for something that is meant for my personal use, and therefore not meant to be published.

## How to use

Simply copy the `template` folder to the desired location, and follow the template's [README] (⚠️ don't forget to edit the title and description).

### degit (recommended)

⚠️ Requires [degit]

```
degit github:lacheteau-s/vue-template/template[#<branch>] <outdir>
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `#<branch>` | `template/base` | Retrieves a specific template version |
| `<outdir>` | `template` | Specifies the output directory |

#### Example:

```
degit github:lacheteau-s/vue-template/template#template/pinia MyApp
```

This will fetch the template with support for `Pinia` and put it in a directory named `MyApp`.

### Clone and copy

⚠️ Requires Git

```bash
git clone [-b <branch>] [--single-branch] git@github.com:lacheteau-s/vue-template.git
cp -R vue-template/template <target-location>
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-b <branch>` | `template/base` | Clones the repository on the specified branch |
| `--single-branch` | off | Prevents Git from fetching all branches (requires Git >= 1.7.10) |
| `target-location` | N/A | Your desired location |

#### Example

```bash
git clone -b template/pinia --single-branch git@github.com:lacheteau-s/vue-template.git
cp -R vue-template/template /home/projects/MyApp
```

This will clone the repository, fetching and checking out only the branch `template/pinia`, and copy the contents of the `template` directory to `/home/projects/MyApp`.

## Purpose

This template is part of a personal initiative to catch up with web development after several years of focusing mostly on desktop, mobile, and backend development.

I chose Vue because it appealed to me more than Angular or React.
It appears to have been [inspired](https://012.vuejs.org/guide/) by the [MVVM] pattern which I have had quite a lot of positive experience with, working with [WPF], and [Xamarin/.NET MAUI].

My end goal here wasn't to merely learn Vue but to also understand the whole ecosystem around it (like [Vite]).
So instead of just initializing a new project with `vuejs/create-vue`, I dug into every file in an effort to understand why things are the way they are, and did a few tweaks where I deemed appropriate, all while gaining precious knowledge.
